        <p>
            Many social media services are designed to maximise engagement between users. If your service is a social media service, you should consider how potential perpetrators may exploit this design for illegal purposes. For example, potential perpetrators may exploit the likelihood of virality to share illegal content with very large groups of people. Social media services can also be used by potential perpetrators of grooming to target young users by sending out many messages. These services are also used in large-scale foreign interference campaigns to spread disinformation. Research shows that social media services can increase the risk of nearly all kinds of illegal harm, except for firearms and other weapons offences where we do not currently have evidence. This may be due to more research on social media services, or greater probability of risk due to the wide range of functionalities and features on many social media services.

                                        Perpetrators can groom children in a multitude of different ways, and there are many different services where grooming is conducted. Social media services, gaming services and messaging services are commonly used in propagating this offence.

                                        There is evidence that social media services are known high-risk spaces for CSAM sharing. This may be in part because some social media services have a large user base. Social media services can be used as directories that allow perpetrators to signpost users to other services where CSAM is shared.

                                        Certain functionalities on social media services have been found to be risk factors. There is evidence of hyperlinks and plain-text URLs to CSAM being posted on social media services in a ‘scattergun’ approach that can drive up web traffic, and income for those hosting CSAM content.
                                    </p>

                                        Social media services can allow potential perpetrators to disseminate suicide or self-harm content. Users can view suicide or self-harm content on these types of services, particularly through the creation of user groups on social media services.

                                        Research indicates that social media services are used to commit and facilitate various forms of abuse and harassment, including threats to kill and misleading information that can result in violence.

                                        Social media services and online gaming services pose a particular risk of hate offences. Users can first build a community of like-minded individuals to share provocative content on a large social media service, without breaching the service’s terms and conditions for hateful conduct. They may then direct their user networks to smaller and less-moderated services.

                                        Social media services offer perpetrators multiple ways to monitor victims and survivors, and to pursue campaigns of targeted abuse. Controlling or coercive behaviour often happens across several social media services simultaneously.

        <p>
            Messaging services allow users to protect their privacy. If your service is a messaging service, you should consider how this design may also be used by potential perpetrators to communicate and share illegal content in a setting that is hidden from public view. This can result in more targeted behaviours and can make detection more difficult, particularly on messaging services with encryption. If you have encrypted messaging on your service, you should refer to the Risk Profile for encrypted messaging because encryption can make detection more difficult.   Potential perpetrators often seek to move other users from services where they initially connected  to messaging services. If you allow users to follow or subscribe to other users on your service, you should refer to the Risk Profile for user connections because potential perpetrators often seek to move other users from services where they initially connected (you should also read the risk profile on user connections) to messaging services.

                                        Social media services and messaging services are shown to be risk factors for both the unlawful immigration and human trafficking offences. Among other elements, they are used to target potential victims and advertise services. Often, perpetrators will identify their victim on social media before transitioning to an encrypted private messaging service to further the facilitation of the offence.

            If your service is a gaming service, you should consider how it may bring potential perpetrators in contact with other users and may create a space where potentially illegal behaviour is normalised. Gaming services can allow hateful content to spread and become sites of normalised harassment, where name-calling or insults are part of user interactions. Gaming services can also be created and modified by terrorist organisations as recruitment tools and be used by potential perpetrators of online grooming to approach children.

            If your service is a marketplace or listings service, you should consider how your service may be used by potential perpetrators to sell or buy illegal goods or services. They are often used in purchase scams in fraud offences and can also be used to raise funds that are used for potentially illegal purposes such as terrorist activities. The ability to make online payments on online marketplaces or listing services can increase the risk of harm.

                                        Any service can be used to distribute CSAM. Services that have the capacity to share images or videos, post text or share hyperlinks pose particular risks. File-storage and file-sharing services, in particular those that allow users to upload and share images through links, are considered particularly risky, facilitating the storage of large, curated collections of CSAM.
