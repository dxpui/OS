                        <p>
                          Many social media services are designed to maximise engagement between users. If your service
                          is a social media service, you should consider how potential perpetrators may exploit this
                          design for illegal purposes. For example, potential perpetrators may exploit the likelihood of
                          virality to share illegal content with very large groups of people. Social media services can
                          also be used by potential perpetrators of grooming to target young users by sending out many
                          messages. These services are also used in large-scale foreign interference campaigns to spread
                          disinformation. Research shows that social media services can increase the risk of nearly all
                          kinds of illegal harm, except for firearms and other weapons offences where we do not
                          currently have evidence. This may be due to more research on social media services, or greater
                          probability of risk due to the wide range of functionalities and features on many social media
                          services.

                          If your service has a high proportion of child users or is aimed at children, your service may
                          be used by potential perpetrators to identify and initiate contact with children for the
                          purposes of grooming them. Child users may also upload, post or share self-generated indecent
                          images (indecent images that are shared often consensually between children and can be
                          non-consensually reshared). These risks can increase for both child sexual abuse material and
                          grooming if your service has direct messaging and/or encrypted messaging. If so, you should
                          refer to the Risk Profiles for direct messaging and encrypted messaging as children may also
                          experience different or increased risks across other kinds of illegal harm. Gender and other
                          protected characteristics of users on your service affects how likely they are to experience

                          User connections may be used by potential perpetrators to build networks and establish contact
                          with users to target, you should also review the risk profile on user profiles . For terrorism
                          and drug offences, user connections can be used by potential perpetrators to connect with
                          thousands of other users to widely share illegal content. Our evidence also suggests that
                          terrorists may exploit these networks to raise funds, in particular if online payments can be
                          made on the service.
                          Potential perpetrators can also use connections to build online networks which can enable them
                          to access other users indirectly. For example, this could be to gain visibility of a target’s
                          user profile in cyberstalking offences or to serve to add legitimacy to fraudsters and their
                          content. These connections can also be used by online groomers to appear as if they are part
                          of a child’s social network allowing them to establish contact with child users and begin
                          communicating.

                                      also be exploited by perpetrators. Perpetrators can often use network recommender

                                      infiltrate groups of children at speed and utilise this as a tool to blackmail and
                                      coerce children to further the sexual abuse.

                          deepfakes can depict participants in legal pornography as children in image-based child sexual

                          Potential perpetrators may try to promote illegal goods or services by posting them for sale
                          using this functionality. Often illegal items such as drugs and firearms are posted for sale
                          using code names. In certain contexts, the ability to post goods or services for sale such as
                          through user-generated advertisements also enables potential perpetrators to advertise and
                          broadcast the sexual services of adults in exploitative environments. The risk of harm can be
                          increased if your services also allows users to make online payments directly.

                                      Content recommender systems can also be a risk factor for this type of content.
                                      The way in which recommender systems are designed can influence the extent to
                                      which harmful and potentially illegal content is recommended to users. Recommender
                                      systems are commonly designed to optimise for user engagement and learn about
                                      users’ preferences through implicit user feedback such as viewing multiple times
                                      and explicit user feedback such as liking, sharing and commenting. While further
                                      evidence is needed, research suggests that where there are vulnerable users who
                                      are engaging with harmful content such as self-harm or suicide content,
                                      recommender systems are more likely to create a filter bubble or rabbit hole. This
                                      may lead to users discovering more content that is harmful or distressing as well
                                      as potentially illegal. If a user is primarily engaging with harmful content, then
                                      this is likely to create a filter bubble where the user is recommended more
                                      harmful content, while other content is deprioritised.
                                    </p>

                                      Evidence shows that these systems are generally designed to optimise user
                                      engagement. In some circumstances this can result in them promoting content which
                                      may be harmful in nature. Recommender systems can improve user experiences through
                                      offering personalised feeds but this can also lead to promoting ideas or
                                      ideologies that users have already engaged with, which can increase confirmation
                                      bias and create filter bubbles.

                          Network recommender systems suggest users or groups of other users to connect with. These
                          systems may connect users in ways that increase risks, for example recommending children

                          facilitate grooming if appropriate checks are not in place.
